    <p>This take on Hamburger Helper has you make your own base and select your choice of noodle.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 minced onion</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded carrot</li>
        <li>1/4 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 cups small pasta, such as elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>1 qt beef broth</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Set a large pot over medium heat. Add the oil to warm. Then, add the beef, onions, and carrots, and cook until the beef has browned, about 8-10 minutes, breaking up the meat as it cooks. Drain any excess fat from the pot.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato sauce, garlic powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the beef broth and turn the heat to high. When it boils, reduce to medium so the liquid simmers with steady but calm bubbles (so just not vigorously).</li>
        <li>Add the pasta to the pot and stir gently.</li>
        <li>Cook until the pasta is just tender and most of the liquid is absorbed, or for about 14-16 minutes. It's OK if there's some liquid remaining, as it will be absorbed as the pasta sits.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the cheese to melt.</li>
    </ol>
